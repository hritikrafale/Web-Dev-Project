            <p>Over the last thirty plus years, the Cincinnati music scene has experienced many changing faces, styles and trends; however
                 the one constant for the last 30+ years has been The Generics. A long running favorite, The Generics have churned out 
                 their own brand of “Hard-stompin’,butt-bumpin’,rock-n-rollin’ rhythm and blues” for Cincinnati music fans at about every 
                 venue and event imaginable. A high energy blend of classic standards, original selections and newer favorites give The 
                 Generics a broad appeal to all area music fans. A rock solid rhythm section together with smooth soulful vocals give The 
                 Generics a sound that can’t miss.
